  <description brief="schunk_wsg50_model">
    This package contains meshes and xacro-based URDF files for the Schunk
    WSG50-110 parallel gripper.

    At the moment, this URDF is for kinematic purposes only, and does not
    contain any dynamics, inertial, control, or simulation properties. Pull
    requests with such additions, are welcome!

    The gripper model has one prismatic joint for each finger:
     - thumb_joint: the finger on the side with the chamfered edge
     - index_joint: the finger on the side without the chamfered edge
